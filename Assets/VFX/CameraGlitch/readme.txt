Camera Glitch ver. 1.0

### Intro ###
Thank you for purchasing Camera Glitch! This readme will help you to get started using the plugin.

### Setup ###
To start using the effect, just add the “Camera Glitch” component to the camera, like any other image effect. 

### Settings ###
You may control intensity of the effect with the “Intensity” property. If set to zero, the effect will have no effect. 
You may hide or show camera overlay with the “Show Overlay” property. It’s hidden by default.
You may change default glitch and overlay textures with the corresponding properties. Just drag any image onto the “Glitch Texture” or “Overlay Texture” properties. The glitch texture will tile automatically, so you may use a texture of any size.

### Compatibility ###
Shader requires Unity Pro and shader model 3.0 or higher to work properly.
